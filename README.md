<h1 align="center">Portfolio Website</h1>

[This](https://alexlostorto.github.io/) website is designed to act as a portfolio for both developers and photographers.

## Other Websites

#### [Space-themed Website](https://alexlostorto.github.io/space-portfolio/)

This website was created in October 2022 (while on holiday in the Netherlands) to act as my portfolio website, except I soon realised... It sucks. So I created a new one! And this time I made sure to take inspiration from a lot of exemplar websites, ensuring that my graphic design isn't entirely trash.

``` python
# Functions
[
'Space-themed Splash Page',
'SparxNotes Extension',
'Thats it'
]
```

#### [Maths-Functions](https://alexlostorto.github.io/maths-functions/)

This website was created in July 2022 to host all my maths functions (even though I code primarily in Python) and utilise the GTP-3 API, which sadly has ran out of credits.

``` python
# Functions
[
'GTP-3 API',  # ran out of credits
'Location API',
'Quizlet Revision',
'Quadratic Solver',
'Prime Number Checker',
'Useful Links',
'Counter'
]
```
